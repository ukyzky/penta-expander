# penta-expander

## ryo penta sequencer expander (eurorack 4HP)

Currently v1 is NOT works well.

(Issue: In summed gate output, a step produces 2 triggers because the step fall down signal overwraps the next step's clock.)

Now planning to improve in v2.

## function

- per step gate output (gate length is a full of step)
- per step on/off switch
- summed gate output (gate length is the same as clock gate length)
- hold on/off switch
- hold input (signal high: hold on)

## bom

T.B.D.
